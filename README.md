For many years I’ve worked as a paralegal representing and advocating for injured workers. I’ve helped people with a range of industrial injuries with the most severe leading to permanent loss of functionality. I’ve done my best to help these individuals, but not all my work results in happy endings. Fortunately, there are enough positive outcomes to keep me motivated and fighting for those whose lives are irreparably changed due to injuries. Nonetheless, in all my time as a lay representative I’ve yet to be able to do that which I wish to do most -truly restore the lost functionality to those marred by disabling injuries.

In 2010, I was hired by my firm and began engaging with these heartbreaking injuries. Throughout the years my hard work has been rewarded with increased opportunities and the responsibility of managing my own claims while also helping other colleagues on their case load. Despite my increased ability to help injured workers, I continue to find myself wishing to do more. One day in 2016, I stumbled across a TED Talk by Hugh Herr, the head of the MIT Media Lab’s Biomechatronic group. I was mesmerized as he described losing his legs in an accident and his journey to improve prosthetics based on his experience. The images of all the maimed client’s I’ve helped flashed in my mind as he discussed using machine learning and biometric readings to make traditional prosthetics seem crude and lifeless. By making real time adjustments, these new prosthetics, can mimic natural movements including walking and running gaits.

Towards the end of the talk, Herr introduced the audience to Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a runner, sister, daughter, dancer, and the victim of the Boston Marathon bombing in which she lost part of her left leg. Despite her recovery efforts, she was near certain traditional prosthetics would never allow her to do one of her favorite activities -dance. Her fears mirrored the endless list of lost abilities I’ve become all to accustomed to hearing about in my line of work. To my surprise, Adrianne was welcomed to the stage aided by one of the advanced prosthetics developed at Herr’s lab. She gracefully and beautifully began to do her first dance performance since losing her leg. The hope and optimism imbedded in each expression of joy as she finished her dance was ineffable and uncontrollably contagious. For the first time, I felt an immense personal connection between technology and its ability to restore human function. I knew in that moment my purpose in life had changed and I needed a new skillset to deliver the impact I wished to have in the lives of others.

I began the enrollment process at Southern New Hampshire University to complete my undergraduate degree the day after watching Hugh Herr’s TED Talk and on the back of years of advocating for injured workers. It was the perfect place for me to reconnect with academia, demonstrate my dedication to learning, and my commitment to being a catalyst for positive change. Most importantly, while pursuing my education I was able to stay connected to my work advocating for injured workers. A source of continued motivation towards my goal of using technology to erase the limitations imposed by disabilities. I graduated Summa Cum Laude in early 2021 with a BS in Computer Science. While pursuing my undergraduate degree I was also granted a scholarship to complete a Nanodegree through Udacity and its partnership with Google in Android Development. Most recently, I was accepted into the Computer Science Graduate Program at the University of Texas at Austin where I will continue to focus my skills in advanced Computer Science and Machine Learning later this year.

I am fully aware of the humble accomplishments on paper that I bring to my pursuit of improving the human experience through technology. However, I am encouraged by my ability to demonstrate success no matter the odds. Overcoming challenges as an immigrant, being successful in the demanding profession of industrial injury law and attaining academic excellence at SNHU to name a few. The knowledge and abilities required to work in biomechatronic may elude me, however, I’ve come to discover that my ability to help others through technology can be vast and varied. Most importantly, I’ve learned that the biggest challenges require us all to play or own unique and vital role. I look forward to being a part of a team that seeks to develop the software and tools to enhance the human condition for others.

## Weather Station Artifact

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yahirRendon/weather_station)

The artifact I chose to use to demonstrate my software design and engineering abilities is the weather station project from CS-350, Emerging Technologies. This project was created in December 2020 as a columniation of work in the final milestone. It consisted of using a RaspberryPi and the GroovePi HAT/sensors to collect weather data. A JSON file is updated at 30-minute intervals during daylight hours only. The specific data collected consists of temperature, humidity, light sensitivity, and dates. Each reading and the data collected is then displayed in a local web dashboard. After developing a user driven interface for the weather station dashboard that demonstrated my software design and engineering abilities, I decided to use this same project to showcase my skill in algorithms and data structures. 

## Weight Tracking Mobile App Artifact

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yahirRendon/my_weight_mobile)

To demonstrate my database abilities, I have selected a mobile application I first developed in CS360 in February of 2021. In this project, I created an Android mobile application that allowed a user to track their weight towards a target weight over time. The mobile app has multiple activities or screens which include a login, profile, settings, and main activity that displays weight data to the user and allows them to enter new weight data. Critical to this project was the use of a database for storing user profile data and user weight entries.


## Weight Tracking Web App Artifact

To further demonstrate my ability to work with databases I used my work on the mobile weight trackign app as an inspiration for creating a web based version that required the developmentof a backend and API routes to connect the front end with a database.
