Three projects were selected to encapsulate my abilities as a software engineer in this portfolio. The first is a weather station project from work I did in CS-350, Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies. The original projects consisted of creating an embedded system using a RaspberryPi and sensors to collect weather data at specified intervals. This data was then displayed to a local web dashboard. This project and its enhancements demonstrate my abilities in software design and engineering by creating a responsive and user driver interface for the web dashboard that is also scalable with more cities and data in the future. This project was also chosen to demonstrate my skill implementing algorithms and working with various data structures. The data collected can be sorted and reversed using algorithms and temperature values can also be searched using two different search algorithms. 

The second and third projects were used to demonstrate my database abilities. The first being an Android mobile application from CS-360 that uses a SQLite database for creating a user profile and tracking user weight entries. This project inspired the third artifact of this portfolio which is a weight tracking web application in which a backend and API was created that allowed similar functionality as the mobile app. However, this project took advantage of a more advanced backend to implement improved security and community sharing of weight entries.
