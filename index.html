    <p class="body_text">
        My journey at SNHU has provided me with an incredible opportunity to learn about the multitude of areas that make of computer science. This experience has been vital as prior to enrolling I new next to nothing when it came to programming, developing software, or where I even fit into the tech world. I only knew that I wanted to work in Robotics and AI and first enrolled under the Information Technology track. My early courses provided me with an understanding of the IT field and after taking a course that required some coding, I quickly realized my interest lied heavily in the challenge of software development with the hope of one day writing software that utilized robotics and/or AI to interact with the real world. I quickly made the change to Computer Science and have not looked back since.

    <!-- program reflection -->
    <div class="title_1">Program Reflection</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        <br><br>
        The challenges I’ve faced over my four years SNHU have served to make me a better person, problem solver, and software engineer. Reflecting on the journey, I have developed insight into many critical computer science fields, areas, and principles. I’ve learned about the various approaches to the software development lifecycle and the critical role teamwork plays in the process. I’ve incorporated Agile development into much of the work that I do after taking CS-250 because of its benefits in process and ability to deliver ready to use incremental features. Working remotely with others has becoming an increasingly important skill and courses like CS-310 were beneficial in shaping my ability to work in a team in a development setting using Git and other collaborative practices and tools. 
        <br><br>
        I’ve always had a fondness for mathematics and enjoyed the various math courses at SNHU such as calculus, applied statistics, applied linear algebra, and discrete mathematics to name a few. These courses were crucial in developing my problem-solving skills and logical thinking that were later applied to courses like CS-260 that worked with algorithms and data structures or CS-410 in which I explored reverse engineering. By overcoming challenges in these foundational practices, I was able to begin thinking like a software engineering. I improved my ability to break problems into smaller ones and find patterns from the small scale that could be applied to a larger scale or problem. While, this ability to find patterns and solve problems is critical it is not sufficient for a software engineer as your solutions must account for the real world and the incorporate the necessary security to meet the threats of today.
        <br><br>
        To understand vulnerabilities in code, programing languages, and external threats course like CS-320 and CS-405 which dealt with testing and secure coding respectively were incredibly insightful. I can think like a software engineer, software tester, and a hacker when writing code to account for as many vulnerabilities and threats as possible. Various courses introduced me to different languages which includes their weakness that could be exploited. Coupling this knowledge with design principles from object-oriented design and operating systems I have a strong knowledge of how my software interfaces with itself and other systems to account for errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, and security concerns. 
        <br><br>
        In courses like website design and mobile architecture I was able to explore software design concepts that I’ve applied to various aspects in and out of school. Additionally, I’ve applied them towards improving all artifacts of this capstone project. Understanding how various elements of code come together and how to optimize their design to deliver a working project was foundational to my capstone work. Working with SQL and Client/Server Development in DAD-220 and CS-340 were informative when creating my own backed and API. Even courses not traditionally consider computer science related such as English and social studies have been impactful towards my work as a software engineer. I’ve learned how to be a better writer and communicator which are critical when working on a team or with the various shareholders involved in the development process.

    <!-- portfolio summary -->
    <div class="title_1">Portfolio Summary</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        Three projects were selected to encapsulate my abilities as a software engineer in this portfolio. The first is a weather station project from work I did in CS-350, Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies. The original projects consisted of creating an embedded system using a RaspberryPi and sensors to collect weather data at specified intervals. This data was then displayed to a local web dashboard. This project and its enhancements demonstrate my abilities in software design and engineering by creating a responsive and user driver interface for the web dashboard that is also scalable with more cities and data in the future. This project was also chosen to demonstrate my skill implementing algorithms and working with various data structures. The data collected can be sorted and reversed using algorithms and temperature values can also be searched using two different search algorithms. 
        <br><br>
        The second and third projects were used to demonstrate my database abilities. The first being an Android mobile application from CS-360 that uses a SQLite database for creating a user profile and tracking user weight entries. This project inspired the third artifact of this portfolio which is a weight tracking web application in which a backend and API was created that allowed similar functionality as the mobile app. However, this project took advantage of a more advanced backend to implement improved security and community sharing of weight entries.

    <p class="body_text">
        My initial desire to work in robotics and AI remains a driving factor for me. Completing my BA in Computer Science is a step towards that goal. The totality of my educational journey at SNHU has prepared me to enter the software development industry while also pursing my specific career goals. I’ve excelled in all my mathematics and computer science courses that have overlaps with robotics and AI. I specifically selected an artifact for my portfolio that not only utilizes software but sensors that interact with the real world as a reflection of my goals within the industry. 
        <br><br>
        Additionally, I am currently enrolled in a Nanodegree from Udacity in Artificial Intelligence using Python and will be applying to graduate school to further improve my knowledge and skills. My work at SNHU has opened many opportunities for me in the future that I look forward to taking on. Despite the inevitable challenges that will come my way I will mee them the same way I meet challenges at SNHU -with hard work and a comment to excellence.
