    <div class="subTitle">Discover my journey and motivations</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        For the last decade I’ve worked as a paralegal representing and advocating for injured workers. I’ve helped people with a
        range of industrial injuries with the most severe leading to permanent loss of functionality. I’ve done my best to
        help these individuals but not all my work results in happy endings. Fortunately, there are enough glimmers of positivity
        to keep me motivated and fighting for those whose lives are irreparably changed due to injuries. Nonetheless, in
        all my time as a paralegal I’ve yet to be able to do that which I wish to do most -truly restore the lost functionality
        to those marred by disabling injuries.
        <br>
        <br> In 2010, I was hired by my firm and began engaging with these heartbreaking injuries. Throughout the years my hard
        work has been rewarded with increased opportunities and the responsibility of managing my own claims while also helping
        other colleagues on their case load. Despite my increased ability to help injured workers, I continue to find myself
        wishing to do more. One day in 2016, I stumbled across a TED Talk by Hugh Herr, the head of the MIT Media Lab’s Biomechatronic
        group. I was mesmerized as he described losing his legs in an accident and his journey to improve prosthetics based
        on his experience. The images of all the maimed client’s I’ve helped flashed in my mind as he discussed using machine
        learning and biometric readings to make traditional prosthetics seem crude and lifeless. By making real time adjustments,
        these new prosthetics, could mimic natural movements including walking and running gaits.
        <br>
        <br> Towards the end of the talk, Herr introduced the audience to Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a runner, sister, daughter,
        dancer, and the victim of the Boston Marathon bombing in which she lost part of her left leg. Despite her recovery,
        she was near certain traditional prosthetics would never allow her to do one of her favorite activities -dance. Her
        fears mirrored the endless list of lost abilities I’ve become all to accustomed to hearing in my line of work. To
        my surprise, Adrianne was welcomed to the stage aided by one of the advanced prosthetics developed at Herr’s lab.
        She gracefully and beautifully began to do her first dance performance since losing her leg. The hope and optimism
        imbedded in each expression of joy as she finished her dance was ineffable and uncontrollably contagious. For the
        first time, I felt an immense personal connection between technology and its ability to restore human function. I
        knew in that moment my purpose in life had changed and I needed a new skillset to deliver the impact I wished to
        have in the lives of others.
        <br>
        <br> I began the enrollment process at Southern New Hampshire University to complete my undergraduate degree the day
        after watching Hugh Herr’s TED Talk and on the back of years of advocating for injured workers. It was the perfect
        place for me to reconnect with academia, demonstrate my dedication to learning, and my commitment to being a catalyst
        for positive change. Most importantly, while pursuing my education I was able to stay connected to my work as a paralegal.
        A source of continued motivation towards my goal of using technology to erase the limitations imposed by disabilities.
        I graduated Summa Cum Laude in early 2021 with a BS in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University. While
        pursuing my undergraduate degree I was also granted a scholarship to complete a Nanodegree through Udacity and its
        partnership with Google in Android Development. I was recently accepted into the Computer Science Graduate Program
        at the University of Texas at Austin where I will continue to focus my skills in advanced Computer Science and Machine
        Learning.
        <br>
        <br> I am fully aware of the humble accomplishments on paper that I bring to this pursuit. However, I am encouraged by
        my ability to demonstrate success no matter the odds. Overcoming challenges as an immigrant, being successful in
        the demanding profession of industrial injury law and attaining academic excellence at SNHU to name a few. The knowledge
        and abilities to work biomechatronic may elude me I’ve come to discover that my ability to help others through technology
        can be vast and varied. Most importantly, I’ve learned that to the biggest challenges require us all to play or own
        unique and vital role. I look forward to being a part of a team that seeks to develop the software and tools to enhance
        the human condition for others.
