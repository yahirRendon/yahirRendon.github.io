    <p class="body_text">
        After developing a user driven interface for the weather station dashboard that demonstrated my software design and engineering abilities, I decided to use this same project to showcase my skill in algorithms and data structures. In summary, the weather station project was developed in December of 2020 as the final milestone in my CS-350, Emerging Technologies course. It consisted of using a RaspberryPi and the GrovePi HAT/sensors to collect weather data. A JSON file is updated at 30-minute intervals during daylight hours only with new entries that contain data for temperature, humidity, light sensitivity, and a date. Each reading and the data is then displayed in a local web dashboard that was greatly enhanced as part of my ePortfolio.

    <div class="title_1">Justification</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        This artifact was chosen for my ePortfolio, and more specifically for this category because it collected various datapoints but originally did very little with them. Having this data available to me seemed like a great opportunity to work with algorithms. As previously mentioned, the data collected was temperature, humidity, light sensitivity, and timestamps. This data is collected in a JSON file which is parsed to create JSON objects and I further create 2D arrays, lists and dictionaries that are passed into CanvasJS and other functions for displaying the data visually to a local website dashboard. This visual displaying of data would further be a great way to demonstrate the result of reverse and sorting algorithms. Additionally, having a data set would also allow me to write binary search and linear search algorithms for searching for temperature values within the dataset.

    <div class="title_1">Reflection</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        Working with data structures and algorithms is an integral part of computer science and development generally. It can be quite challenging to visualize an algorithm or logically implement one. However, it is a great way to grow and learn as a developer and problem solver. It is an element of computer science I have always been drawn to and enjoy attempting to implement algorithms and working with data structures. During the process of writing my quick sort and binary search algorithms I hit several issues. Working with recursive algorithms can be tricky as you can wind up in infinite loops or terminating a function prematurely if your logic is not correct. However, I was able to write test functions for controlled datasets and log my work to ensure success before applying them to my project. 
        <br><br>
        Another challenge I found was that sorting or searching through an array can be quite easy but when working with a dictionary, multidimensional arrays, or data the comes in pairs it requires modification of the standard implementation of these algorithms to specify which element you are sorting by and how to keep those items together as they move around. Additionally, after sorting or searching you are doing something with this data, so the return type or data structure has to be formated properly. This was an issue when trying to pass data into the CanvasJS charts as it had to be compatible. However, with testing, utilizing best practices, and appropriate planning I was able to overcome these challenges. 
        <br><br>
        The enhancements made to this artifact greatly improved the project by allowing the user to interact with the dataset in unique ways like sorting from low to high, sorting from high to low, reversing data, and searching within the data. This was done by increasing my knowledge of working with JSON objects, utilizing various data structures and incorporating efficient and modern algorithms into an existing project. All prior elements remained functional but provided improved functionality to the end user by thoughtful uses of algorithms and data structures.
