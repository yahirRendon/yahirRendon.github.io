    <!-- project explanation and details -->
    <div class="title_1">Description</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        To demonstrate my database abilities, I have selected a mobile application I first developed in CS360 in February of 2021.
        In this project, I created an Android mobile application that allowed a user to track their weight towards a target
        weight over time. The mobile app has multiple activities or screens which include a login, profile, settings, and
        main activity that displays weight data to the user and allows them to enter new weight data. Critical to this project
        was the use of a database for storing user profile data and user weight entries.
    </p>

    <div class="title_1">Justification</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        I chose this project to include as an artifact in my ePortfolio as it is the primary example of working with a database that
        I have from all of my SNHU course work. I also enjoyed the real-world application of this project as something that
        could be seen on the Google Play store. The project provide a framework to demonstrate my ability to work with a
        SQLite database which includes creating a database/data tables as well as performing all CRUD operations. I also
        saw an extended potential for creating a similar project but as a web application. The same concept of allowing a
        user to store weight entries could be created in a manner that allowed for social engagement towards their goals.
        This would require a database that allowed for multiple users to be able to create accounts and still perform CRUD
        operation while implementing backend safeguards.
    </p>

    <div class="title_1">Reflection</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        The enhancements to the mobile application did not present too many challenges for me. I did a great job when initially developing
        the project of commenting my code and thinking modularly. My database helper class was structured such that changes
        to the database could be made rather quickly. I did have to spend some time learning to incorporate the shared preferences
        option within Android devices to shift some of the user preferences from the SQLite database. I was able to reference
        the Android development documentation to get the proper understanding for storing and retrieving shared preference
        data.
        <br>
        <br> The biggest challenge came when trying to use the mobile application as an inspiration for the web application.
        The only context I had was some prior work using RESTful API but the process of developing a backend database and
        my own endpoints was a foreign one. I spent several days researching backend frameworks and settled on using Flask
        due to its documentation. The process of creating my own backend was very challenging but served as a great lesson
        when it comes to demonstrating real-world applications of my database abilities.
        <br>
        <br> After diligently working on these two projects as was able to make great enhancements to them. In the mobile app,
        I updated the database helper class that I previously created to make my database more efficient and reflective of
        what would exist in a professional setting. I modified the functions for creating the database, dropping the database,
        inserting, updating, reading, and deleting data while preserving all the existing functionality. In the web application
        I was able to similarly create the appropriate database schema and logic for creating user profiles and storing user
        entries into the data table. Additionally, I used hashing on the user password to improve security as the database
        doesn’t reside on an individual’s device. Finally, the use of custom routes or endpoints in my API that used proper
        SQL queries for retrieving data drastically improved the overall functionality of these projects and showcased my
        ability to work with databases.
