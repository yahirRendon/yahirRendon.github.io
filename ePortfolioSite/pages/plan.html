    <div class="title_1">Refinement Plan</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        During my time at SNHU much of my success can de attributed to planning and reviewing my process, work, goals. Courses move quickly and it is important to be intentional about your time and the work you are doing. Even with properly planning for each course’s final milestone, several projects have left a lingering desire to be able to do more with them. Fortunately, this capstone projected provided a wonderful opportunity to revisit some of these prior projects, review my work, develop a plan for enhancements, and communicate my approach for implementing such changes which is presented here.
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <div class="title_2">Software Design & Engineering</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        There are a lot of elements and pieces that must come together to deliver good and meaningful software. Design and engineering the arrangements and connections between all those elements is critical to a software engineer. To demonstrate my abilities within this category I selected a project I worked on in my Emerging Technology course that had me creating a web dashboard for weather data that I had collected. The focus of the course was more so on using sensors in an embedded system and left the dashboard rather simple and plain. I decided to use this project to showcase my ability to design a better UI and engineer a project that could be scalable over time.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I am collecting temperature, humidity, light sensitivity, and timestamps but only displaying one plot chart between temperature and humidity. I would like to create a dashboard that is able to communicate to the user basic information such as the last reading date/time, the average temperature and humidity as well as have multiple charts and graphs to highlight each category. Finally, I would like to make it possible for additional datasets form other cities to be incorporated into the project. 
        <br><br>
        To accomplish these changes, I plan to learn two JavaScript Libraries, CanvasJS and JQuery, to introduce additional complexity into this project and improve the overall functionality to the end user. The process of designing a more meaningful web dashboard will also require the use of HTML and CSS to create a responsive application that can be comfortably used on various devices. I will also consider scalability and engineer a solution that utilizes JSON to populate the dashboard based on user selection. In time, additional JSON files can be added to the code allowing for weather data to be used from around the country. It is also critical that my solutions allow for the existing Python code that captures weather data from a RaspberryPi using the necessary sensors to remain functional. 
    </p>

    <div class="title_2">Algorithms & Data Structures</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        All my computer science courses utilized data structures such as arrays, lists hash tables, stacks, tress, etc. depending on the in final project requirements. Additionally, I also worked with algorithms in C++ and explored others for my own projects. However, I realized a great opportunity to demonstrate my ability to work with algorithms and data structures was to work with the data I was already collecting from the weather station project I previously mentioned. The improved web dashboard presented a great opportunity to not only work with data structures and algorithms under the hood but present this ability to the user in a visually pleasing way. 
        <br><br>
        My plan will be use the temperature and humidity data and various data structures from a simple array, lists, and JSON dictionary to create a quick sort algorithm that will sort the values from low to high and a reverse algorithm to reorder the data. Additionally, I will write a binary search algorithm to check if a desired data set contains a temperature and even implement a linear search algorithm to return all dates/readings for a desired temperature. This will require me to convert a quick sort algorithm I wrote in C++ into JavaScript and also do research on implementing the search algorithms. 
    </p>

    <div class="title_2">Databases</div>

    <p class="body_text">
        The most challenging and enjoyable project I created at SNHU was a mobile application that tracked a user’s weight over time. This project utilized a SQLite database that was housed on the user’s device to store profile data as well as all of the weight entries from the user. I decided to revisit this project and improve my database schema to reflect real world development more accurately. I will also use this project as inspiration to recreate a similar version as a full stack web application in which data will not be stored on an individual users device but the backed will be created to be able to be uploaded to a server and allow for multiple users. 
        <br><br>
        To accomplish this goal, I will first rework my mobile application to have a more appropriate schema. The original three data tables will be refined to just two and user preferences will be stored utilizing the built in Android shared preferences standard. I will need to rewrite my database helper class and modify all the CRUD operations that used the prior data tables. For the web application, this is a bit of an ambitious plan for me as I’ve never worked on back-end development. I will need to research a back-end framework to utilize and create a database and simple UI that will allow users to create accounts, login, view weight entries, add weight entries, and modify prior entries. Given that more users can create accounts via this format I will also consider adding messages to weight tracking entries such to create a community element for others to see. This would be similar to the way applications like Venmo displays user transactions to the community. 
        <br><br>
        Implementing these changes to my original project and creating the backed for the web application will demonstrate my ability to work with databases to perform all of the standard CRUD operations in an application that can be used in the real-world. However, being able to use this idea to create a new project that utilizes databases will also demonstrate my creative ability and flexibility to continue expanded on my knowledge even it requires learning something entirely new.

    <p class="body_text">
         While it is ideal to perform code reviews on the work of peers to benefit from a fresh pair eyes, I performed a detailed code review of my own work for the weather station and mobile application projects. I reviewed code for best practices, appropriate logic, bugs, errors, and general improvements. Additionally, I explore the desired enhancements outlined above and their implementation.
